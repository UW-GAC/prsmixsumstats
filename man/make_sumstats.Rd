\title{Make summary statistics}
\usage{
make_sumstats(x, y, center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{design matrix with rows as individual observations}

\item{y}{vector with outcomes, length should match nrow(x)}

\item{center}{boolean for whether to center and scale x and y}
}
\value{
sumstats object with elements xx and xy
}
\description{
From input design matrix x and outcome vector y, compute x'x and x'y
}
\details{
important: x and y must have the same number of subjects
and ordered the same way according to subject ID, but ID 
should not be a column of X

returns a sumstats object, which contains two list elements:
1. matrix of x'x where x is nxp design matrix
2. vector of x'y where y is nx1 trait vector
attributes of the sumstats object: nsubj, nmiss, nobs, colsum, ysum, yssq
}
